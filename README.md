# Chess
This project was made to settle a beef between two weirdo's who thought making a chess engine is a fun thing to do. It's mainly based on the chess module which allows me to be lazy and not code the entire set of rules chess is notorious for. However, the idea behind it is to try and code the engine part from scratch and optimize it as much as possible and eventually... let our creations battle one another to the death. 

There are two main dependencies consisting of the "chess" and "pygame" modules. I believe I also included Fore from Colorama to print nice red error messages. Other than that, the repo should be good to be deployed. "Random", "math" and "time" are also used, but if you don't have those already, you're just weird. Notice that there is also an executable included for now, which should maybe hopefully work, this is because the engine is actually a bit faster in this form. And goddamn, it's 47 MB, so maybe just ignore it.

P.S. (idk if this is a correctly used english abbreviation) I'm very garbage at coding, and as a direct result of that this project itself is also incredibly garbage, please send me your prayers because I will most definitely get demolished.
